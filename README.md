2. Navigate to the ZIP file and unzip it.
3. Navigate to the `Solution` folder in the project file and double click `faq.html`.

### What I learned
I've become too accustomed to Tailwind and more backend focused projects. This was a good refresher on Semantic HTML and CSS basics, especially @media queries. 

### Useful resources
- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/) continually prove to be incredibly valuable, whether its HTML, CSS, or (most often) Javascript.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5
- CSS
